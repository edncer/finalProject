	<h3>Istanbul Modern</h3>

	</div>
	
	<p>Forced to leave its original location on the shores of Karaköy due to ongoing construction work in the area, Istanbul's foremost modern arts museum moved earlier this year to a smaller, temporary location in the Beyoğlu/Pera area. Founded in 2004 as Turkey’s first museum of modern and contemporary art, Istanbul Modern continues to host exhibitions as well as its permanent collection and eventually plans on moving back to Karaköy once its facility there is rebuilt. The in-house cinema regularly screens independent films programmed around ongoing exhibitions, contemporary directors and stand-alone events. </p>



	<h5>Hours: Tuesday - Sunday <br>10.00 - 18.00</h5>
	<h5>Address: Asmalimescit Mahallesi, Mesrutiyet Caddesi No.99<br> 34430 Beyoglu/Istanbul, Turkey</h5>

<h3>Museum of Innocence</h3>

	<p>
Inspired by renowned novelist Orhan Pamuk's novel of the same name, the Museum of Innocence is nestled in the picturesque quarter of Çukurcuma, where much of the book transpires. The countless number of household objects and photographs meticulously collected and displayed in the museum are connected to the bittersweet love story that unfolds in the novel. Taking his cue from the works of Joseph Cornell, Pamuk has arranged these objects into installations and collages housed in custom-built vitrines, which gleam like cabinets of curiosities inside the dimly lit museum. The winner of the European Museum of the Year Award in 2014, the Museum of Innocence is a must-see for readers of the book as well as anyone interested in the cultural and material history of Istanbul. Note that the ticket printed in the closing pages of the novel can be stamped at the ticket booth in exchange for an entrance to the museum.
