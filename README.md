# Project Title
	Istanbul Travel Guide

## Purpose
	Final Project

## Creative Brief
	This website is designed to offer tourists to experience Istanbul with a local's point of view. Rather than the famous historic and touristic districts, our intention is to provide information about ongoing art events. 

	While many travel blogs and websites already exist, this website's focus being on one single city makes it unique. Our audience has the opportunity to find out about events and relevant information rather than searching through multiple pages as on the other travel blogs. 

	Information and photos provided are taken from the website's of the relevant places. Pictures on the home page are and will be filtered in order to make titles legible. The illutration, which reflects a silhouette of the city of Istanbul featuring, domes, minarets, Galata Tower and Bosphorus Bridge at top of the pages are made by myself.  

	The city has long been a cultural center and famous tourist destination. Our audience is the foreign visitors who are looking for an experience other than the well-known palaces and foods. Therefore, the website is not and will not be translated to Turkish.  

	My inspirations include CN Traveler, Travel + Leisure, Along Dusty Roads, Vogue travel articles, timeout Istanbul. 

## Online Marketing
	As the website's main audience are the international tourists, who also enjoy art events, it can be translated to languages other than English, or Turkish.

	Our target are the visitors whose goal is not to post about their trip on social media as much as possible; we want to help them to enjoy their stay in Istanbul more like a local and provide them information about the latest art and culture events. Therefore social media ads will not help our target to hear about us. I would recommend collaborating with both well-known travel websites as well as local websites and blogs. Yet, google adwords 'istanbul hotels', 'istanbul restuarants', 'travel', 'local'. 'istanbul art' will need to be used to be found at the beginning.
